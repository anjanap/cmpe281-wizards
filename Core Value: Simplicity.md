Week 1: Our discussions have been around making minimalistic features, so that we learn and master the core features 
before going fancy and add additional features (if time permits). For instance, when we were discussing the flow of the 
sequence, we were brainstorming around how we'll know if all the products in the cart at a particular time is the final order.
Should we notify everyone that we are placing the order and give them a way for them to validate if it is indeed their 
final order? Receiving validation from everyone who has access to the  cart is an overhead. Instead we decided to send out 
a group notification at the time of creation of the cart and simply place a timer on the cart visible to everyone,
after which order will be final. Simple and efficient.
