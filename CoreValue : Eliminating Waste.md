#### XP Core Value: Eliminating Waste

Eliminating waste acts as a key item for the success of a project and plays a crucial role in completion of a project within the given time frame. In every team meeting, team members come up with various approaches to build the product and solve a problem. Eliminating waste comes in play when we have to determine if an action taken by the team adds up to the common goal of success of the project or not. We have to decide if we are putting efforts towards a single objective and not diverging from the correct path.
