XP Core Value: Respect 
A significant value that underlies the way we work is respect towards the fellow project mates.
There are many components for this core value. 
For instance, one of my teammate commutes a long way to participate in project meetings and other discussions. 
In order to make things easier, we as a group decided to carry on the meeting online. 
As stepping up as a group for fellow teammate plays a crucial role.
